# Finance-tracker
This Python script reads an HTML file, parses it with BeautifulSoup, and provides a Tkinter-based UI to add income entries. Users enter amount, category, and notes, which are printed via a dummy `add_transaction` function. It includes basic input validation and success/error popups.
